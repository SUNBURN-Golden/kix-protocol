# ASTRA trusted-workflow boundary — ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_STARTED pre-job hook.
#
# Runs inside the runner worker before any job step, action pre-entrypoint or
# container initialization. The policy decision is made by
# control_plane_boundary.py (same directory). On DENY the hook must not merely
# exit nonzero: the runner injects this hook as one pre-job step, and
# `if: always()`/`failure()` steps would still execute after a failed step.
# Denial therefore terminates the Runner.Worker process itself after writing
# the durable decision record, so no user-controlled code can run.
#
# This file and its policy must be installed read-only to the runner/job
# security context (root-owned outside the runner work directory in
# production; read-only bind mount for the isolated probe). The interpreter
# is hardcoded (/usr/bin/python3 -I) and denial always attempts worker
# termination: ASTRA_BOUNDARY_* execution overrides are NOT a configuration
# channel — the former ASTRA_BOUNDARY_PYTHON / ASTRA_BOUNDARY_KILL /
# ASTRA_BOUNDARY_FLUSH_SECONDS bypasses no longer exist and are rejected by
# `check-env`. ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_STARTED and the ASTRA_BOUNDARY_POLICY*
# /ASTRA_BOUNDARY_EVIDENCE_DIR pins must come from the listener launch
# environment — never from job-writable state or a runner .env.

# The runner invokes this file as `bash -e <path>`; disable errexit so the
# deny path (log, flush, worker termination) always executes.
