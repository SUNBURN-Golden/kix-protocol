# Offline settlement statement adapter

`StatementSource.fetch(settlement_id, movement_id)` is an internal Python
interface. A record has exactly `settlement_id`, `movement_id`, `gross`,
`amount`, `fee`, `tax`, `held`, `adjustment`, and `adjustment_reason` (explicitly
`None` when appropriate). These are existing FSM arguments, not a wire schema.

`StatementAdapter.apply(operation=..., settlement_id=..., movement_id=...,
idempotency_key=...)` fetches once per explicit request, including replay.
The caller selects `commit` or `observe_statement` and supplies the key.
Unsupported selectors fail before fetching. Missing records, invalid shape and
identity mismatch raise local source/record exceptions before any FSM call.
Components pass through unchanged; the FSM alone validates amounts, phases,
movement bindings and idempotency. Results and `SettlementError` propagate
unchanged. There is no retry, fallback, cached result or inferred fee.

`FakeStatementSource(recordings=...)` copies a mapping from identity pairs to
immutable JSON text or `SyntheticStatementFault.ERROR/TIMEOUT`. Its recordings
are read-only, fetched documents are freshly parsed, and `calls` is a tuple
snapshot. Faults raise `StatementSourceError` immediately; timeout is a synthetic
marker with no clock, waiting or statement-absence meaning.

Run from the repository root, with only Python's standard library:

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 reference/settlement_f01_f03/example_statement_adapter.py
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s reference/settlement_f01_f03 -t reference/settlement_f01_f03
```

The callable `run_example(*, policy, order)` requires both fixture inputs.
Its script entry point supplies visibly synthetic values. It explicitly
initiates, authorizes, captures, commits the first statement, observes a later
statement, then separately distributes. Statements never distribute cash.
Receipts retain `MOCK_SETTLEMENT_ONLY` and all existing false flags;
`chain_finality=False` belongs only to the example report.

Existing coverage inventory (recorded before adding adapter tests):

| Requirement | Coverage before this change | Existing evidence / adapter gap |
|---|---|---|
| Coverage inventory and mock posture | Sufficiently covered | `docs/status/SETTLEMENT_CONTRACT_EVIDENCE_MAP.md`; `test_adopted_policy.py::AdoptedPolicyTests.test_adopted_policy_posture` and `test_t0_tax_and_held_stay_non_cash`. |
| Conservation and component rejection | Partially covered | `test_mock_settlement.py::SettlementMockTests.test_f02_statement_does_not_infer_fee_or_shrink_faces`; `test_settlement_properties.py::ConservationPropertyTests.test_b_c_seeded_sequences_conserve_and_rejections_change_nothing`; commit/observe matrices in `test_settlement_rejection_atomicity.py`. Adapter forwarding/parity absent. |
| Replay, conflicts and rejection keys | Partially covered | `test_settlement_fsm.py::SettlementFsmTests.test_same_key_replays_and_a_different_body_is_rejected`; `test_returned_data_isolation.py::ReturnedResultReplayTests.test_mutated_first_and_duplicate_results_preserve_original_replay`; rejection/restore probes in `test_settlement_rejection_atomicity.py`. Adapter replay and later key probes absent. |
| Duplicate movement and illegal phase | Partially covered | `test_settlement_properties.py::BindingPropertyTests.test_d_statement_binding`; `test_settlement_fsm.py::SettlementFsmTests.test_illegal_transitions_do_not_move_the_phase`; observe binding/phase tests in `test_settlement_rejection_atomicity.py`. Adapter path absent. |
| One fetch, exact forwarding, unchanged result/error object | Not covered | New `test_statement_adapter.py` wraps actual FSM methods and compares direct execution. |
| Immutable copied recordings and call snapshots | Not covered | New `test_statement_source.py` exercises constructor/output isolation and deterministic faults. |
| Missing/fault/mismatched/invalid source record leaves keys free | Not covered | New adapter tests verify zero FSM calls, unchanged state/journal and successful later use of the same key. |
| Runnable example and separate distribution | Not covered | New adapter example test checks intermediate cash, final conservation, caller policy/order and false flags. |
| CI discovery | Sufficiently covered for suite wiring | Existing `protocol.yml` discovers the entire settlement directory; run `check_ci_test_discovery.py` and its self-test with the new tests present. |

This addition follows settlement contract §§3 and 9 and adopted
`SET-POLICY-DRAFT-0.3`. It changes no FSM, arithmetic, contract, catalogue, SDK or
gate. New-key duplicate-movement journaling is an existing implementation
characterization, not a new contract. Product policy remains **UNDETERMINED**
with Astra/User and the existing I10 legal, tax and accounting owners. No
network, persistence, real services, credentials, funds, chain execution,
runtime activation, production durability or P04 closure is supplied.
