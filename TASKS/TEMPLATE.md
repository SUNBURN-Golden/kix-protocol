# TASK ENVELOPE v4

Store this envelope on the canonical GitHub task, not as a new runtime file.
Link the existing specification; do not rewrite or duplicate it.

## Required intake

TASK_ID:
PROJECT:
REPO:
CANONICAL_TASK_POINTER:
TASK_REVISION:
TASK_SPEC_POINTER:
TASK_SPEC_REVISION:
APPROVAL_POINTER:
AUTHORITATIVE_DOC_POINTERS:

The pinned specification must identify objective, scope, exclusions,
constraints/contracts and acceptance/verification criteria. Exact section
pointers suffice; the same issue may supply every section. No separate
Astra approval is required for an already authorized, well-scoped task.
Missing consequential requirements need clarification; repository investigation
and ordinary implementation choices belong to the assigned builder.

## Fixed defaults from the pinned central project profile

Resolve the central commit from `.github/control-plane-client.json` and read
`engineering/projects/kix-protocol.md` at that commit. Candidate adoption status
is recorded in `docs/CONTROL_PLANE_POINTER.md`; this template does not activate it.

EXECUTION_CLASS: BUILDER_STANDARD
BUILDER_ID: CONFIG_REQUIRED
DELIVERABLE_MODE: PR
AUDIT_FLOOR: A1
ASTRA_GATE: NONE
REVIEW_POLICY: REQUIRED_NON_A0
REVIEWER_LANE_ID: CONFIG_REQUIRED

For BUILDER_STANDARD, BUILDER_ID must resolve to one configured builder adapter
such as DEVIN, GROK_BUILD, GLM or CURSOR before dispatch. Grok never chooses the builder
or reviewer by reading the task.

REPO/PROJECT must match the project map. Verification/post-merge policy comes
from that map and repository rules. Overrides require a durable authorized
pointer. An unavailable builder/reviewer lane cannot silently waive or transfer
ownership.

A3 always implies ASTRA_GATE=ARCHITECTURE.
Other ASTRA_GATE values: NONE | MILESTONE | ARCHITECTURE | RELEASE.

## Conditional pointers

EXECUTION_PROFILE_POINTER: OPTIONAL

When supplied, link the exact qualified harness/model report selected by the
configured builder profile. This is a reference, not a free-form model choice,
qualification result or permission to change an active session's builder/model.

CONTRACT_POINTERS:
INVARIANT_POINTERS:
LOCKED_AREAS_POINTERS:
PHASE_OR_LAYER_POINTER:

Use exact task-spec sections or existing repository documents; N/A is allowed
only when no such requirement applies. Existing project-specific requirements
remain mandatory, including KIX immutable docs/tasks specifications.

For CHEAP_MECHANICAL/A0 only:
A0_AUTHORIZATION_POINTER:
A0_CHANGE_KIND: TYPO | FORMAT_ONLY | DOC_MECHANICAL
A0_ALLOWED_PATHS:
A0_FORBIDDEN_PATHS:

Other allowed DELIVERABLE_MODE values:
NO_CHANGE_ALLOWED | NON_CODE_EVIDENCE.
Other AUDIT_FLOOR values: A0 | A2 | A3.
A0 requires the runbook's final qualification.

## Dispatch references

CONTROL_RECORD_POINTER:
CANONICAL_SLACK_THREAD:

These are provisioned by intake/User before execution; they are not invented
by Grok. If Slack is used, task and thread link to each other. Mutable
claim/session/HEAD/gate state belongs in the control record, not the task spec.

Builder/reviewer reassignment is a durable control action. It must not create a
second writer or bypass an unresolved SUBMITTING/UNKNOWN launch.

## Owner instruction

Follow the pinned task and repository rules. As the assigned builder,
investigate, implement, debug, test/fix/retest and deliver the PR without
routine plan approval.

Do not silently change approved architecture, contracts, authority/security
boundaries or consequential semantics. When such a change is required, stop
the affected change and submit DECISION_REQUIRED / architecture-exception
evidence.

CI/review/Astra-gate feedback returns to the same active owner unless a durable
authorized reassignment fences the prior attempt.

## Completion evidence index

- task revision; observed base SHA; PR and exact final HEAD/evidence SHA;
- complete changed paths and acceptance criterion -> test/CI evidence pointers;
- actual commands/results and repository-required evidence;
- TOUCHED_AREAS and CONTRACT_CHANGE_REQUIRED: NO | YES (advisory only);
- BUILDER_ID and independent review pointer when available;
- VERIFIED_REVIEW_DEPTH / touched areas / contract-change result when reviewed;
- Astra-gate pointer/result only when ASTRA_GATE requires it;
- unverified behavior, remaining risks, BLOCKED/STALLED when applicable.

The independent reviewer verifies touched areas and contract-change requirements for routine A1/A2 work. Astra independently re-verifies them only on an applicable Astra gate. This index does not replace repository evidence requirements or independent examination.
No transcript, repeated status or mutable execution state belongs here.

Missing required fields: BLOCKED / INCOMPLETE_TASK_ENVELOPE, field names only.
