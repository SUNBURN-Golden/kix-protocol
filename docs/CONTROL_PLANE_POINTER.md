# Shared engineering policy pointer

Shared policy owner: `BeautifulMind-JT/ai-ops-control-plane`.
Target product: `BeautifulMind-JT/kix-protocol`.

Candidate policy: https://github.com/BeautifulMind-JT/ai-ops-control-plane/tree/3e7c64a515e908b312604e82405b963d100caa07/engineering
Status: pending central PR acceptance and this product's policy adoption; this
candidate is not evidence of installed runtime, builder qualification or activation.

The machine-readable pin is `.github/control-plane-client.json`.
Project defaults come from pinned `engineering/projects/kix-protocol.md`.
Builder/model qualification uses the pinned central policy. Astra is Claude Fable, run by the
central `aiops-fable` tool (User decision M5, 2026-09-30).
Product contracts, task specifications, protected files and product CI remain here.
GitHub task/decision/audit records remain authoritative; Slack is a collaboration surface.

Migration history: https://github.com/BeautifulMind-JT/ai-ops-control-plane/issues/1
Historical source, audit and activation evidence retains its original SHA and scope.
No local dispatcher is installed by this reference change. Existing deployment,
fence and rollout decisions are unchanged; never run two dispatchers for one task.
User-authorized merge; program mode delegates only the merge executor (User decision M1,
`AGENTS.md` program mode section). No automatic fallback, retries, polling or standing routines.

All four central target profiles retain deployment_enabled=true (eligibility).
The candidate global runtime is disabled pending fresh implementation/host evidence;
this client pin does not enable a dispatcher or expand a host allowlist.
